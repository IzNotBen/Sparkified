# TODO

- Main (Aimed to be completed.)
 - OAuth2 needs to be fixed, somehow the program is not handling refresh tokens properly.
 - Better Server Integration; Spark seems to be missing some freatures that many users appreciated, aiming to repair or reporpose them.

- On my list
 - Fixing TTS; many players greatly appreciate TTS, and I may be able to incorporate an alternative.
 - Creating a new database; I may be able to host a new database for player stat tracking and for recording personalised player info as well.

- Unlikely but possible
 - Creating a new bot; By creating a new discord application, it can be integrated into servers for convinient stack checking and may also fix other authentication related issues.
